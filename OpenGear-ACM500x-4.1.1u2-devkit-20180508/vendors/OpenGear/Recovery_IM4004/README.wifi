WiFi on the IM4004-5 WITH SPARKLAN WLAN CARDS
---------------------------------------------

0. SPARKLAN CardBus WLAN card

Like most modern wifi chips the Ralink RT2860 in the CardBus card can do
alot of authentication and encryption on chip. The traditional "iwconfig"
command cannot set a lot of the modes you will want to use.

"iwpriv" will let you get at all the extra special features of the RT2860

For example for my local wifi network I use:

	ifconfig ra0 192.168.0.111
	iwpriv ra0 set NetworkType=Infra
	iwpriv ra0 set AuthMode=WPAPSK
	iwpriv ra0 set EncrypType=TKIP
	iwpriv ra0 set SSID="gerg"
	iwpriv ra0 set WPAPSK="xxxxxxxxxx"
	iwpriv ra0 set SSID="gerg"

to set it up. I run WPA authentication with TKIP encryption. After you 
have run the above iwconfig will report useful info. But before these
commands it doesn't do a lot of useful things for you.

See the RT2860 doco for more info:

1. SPARKLAN USB WLAN card

Like most modern wifi chips the Ralink RT73 in the USB adapter can do
alot of authentication and encryption on chip. The traditional "iwconfig"
command cannot set a lot of the modes you will want to use.

"iwpriv" will let you get at all the extra special features of the RT73.

For example for my local wifi network I use:

	ifconfig rausb0 192.168.0.111
	iwpriv rausb0 set NetworkType=Infra
	iwpriv rausb0 set AuthMode=WPAPSK
	iwpriv rausb0 set EncrypType=TKIP
	iwpriv rausb0 set SSID="gerg"
	iwpriv rausb0 set WPAPSK="xxxxxxxxxx"
	iwpriv rausb0 set SSID="gerg"

to set it up. I run WPA authentication with TKIP encryption. After you 
have run the above iwconfig will report useful info. But before these
commands it doesn't do a lot of useful things for you.
