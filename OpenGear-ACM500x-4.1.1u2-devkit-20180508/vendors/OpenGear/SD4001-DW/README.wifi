WiFi on the SD4001-DW
---------------------

Like most modern wifi chips the Ralink RT73 in the USB adapter can do
alot of authentication and encryption on chip. The traditional "iwconfig"
command cannot set a lot of the modes you will want to use.

"iwpriv" will let you get at all the extra special features of the RT73.

For example for my local wifi network I use:

	ifconfig rausb0 192.168.0.111
	iwpriv rausb0 set NetworkType=Infra
	iwpriv rausb0 set AuthMode=WPAPSK
	iwpriv rausb0 set EncrypType=TKIP
	iwpriv rausb0 set SSID="gerg"
	iwpriv rausb0 set WPAPSK="xxxxxxxxxx"
	iwpriv rausb0 set SSID="gerg"

to set it up. I run WPA authentication with TKIP encryption. After you 
have run the above iwconfig will report useful info. But before these
commands it doesn't do a lot of useful things for you.
