Opengear Lighthouse VM Deployment Guide

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lighthouse VM can be run as a guest virtual appliance under:

  - Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (Linux KVM)
  - VMware ESX, VMware ESXi
  - VMware Server, VMware Workstation

The host may be a physical machine that you administer, or a managed server or
a cloud hosting service from a hosting provider.


System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At a minimum, the Lighthouse VM requires the following reserved resources:

  - 500MHz CPU core
  - 256MB RAM
  - 4GB disk space

In addition, the following virtual devices are required:

  - Disk device, SATA/SCSI or IDE
  - E1000 compatible Ethernet NIC, bridged


Distributed Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Opengear Lighthouse VM is released as a firmware upgrade file (*.bin) and
a full image (*.gz).  The full image is used for the initial deployment,
firmware upgrade files are used thereafter for upgrades.

Upgrades and full images are available from:

  http://www.opengear.com/firmware/

Which full disk image you deploy depends on your virtualization solution:

  - For Linux KVM, use the raw HDD image:
            lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.hdd.gz
  - For VMware ESX/ESXi, use the deployment OVF:
            lighthouse-x.y.z-vm-ovf.zip
  - For VMware Server or Workstation, use the HDD image with VMDK wrapper:
            lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.tar.gz

When upgrading any Lighthouse VM platform, you can use the same firmware upgrade file::
            lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.bin

Uncompress the full image using gunzip, Winzip or similar before deployment.
Follow the instructions provided by your virtualization management suite to
deploy the ovf, vmx or hdd file as appropriate.

Examples are given below for VMware ESXi 4, VMware Workstation 7, and
ElasticHosts cloud hosting provider.


Example deployment: VMware ESXi 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete this deployment you must have VMware ESXi 4 installed and
running on a bare metal machine, and the VMware vSphere Client installed on a
PC running Microsoft Windows.

Before proceeding, download and extract the full disk image for VMWare ESXi, as
described in the "Distributed Files" section.

  1.	Launch the vSphere Client and log into the ESXi with a user who has
	administrator privileges.

  2.	In the vSphere Client, select File: Deploy OVF Template.  The Deploy
	OVF Template wizard is displayed.

  3.	Specify the source location and click Next.

  4.	Select Deploy from File and Browse the file system for location where
	you extracted the contents of: lighthouse-x.y.z-vm-ovf.zip

	Select the OVF template file, e.g.: Lighthouse-vm.ovf

  5.	Check the OVF Template Details page and click Next.

  6.	If required, edit the OVF Template name.

  7.	Review the Ready to Complete details.  To re-edit Source, OVF Template
	Details and Name and Location, click on the respective link on the left
	hand side of the window.  Click Finish when complete.

  8.	The OVF Template is now displayed in the left-hand vSphere Client
	Status panel under the relevant host.

  9.	To start the virtual machine, select the Virtual Machine tab from the
	right-hand panel.  Select the Virtual Machine by name, and click the
	Play button from the top menu.

  10.	Deployment is now complete.  You can monitor the Lighthouse VM boot
	progress using the vSphere Client console, or proceed to "Configuring
	Lighthouse VM" to begin configuration.


Example deployment: VMware Workstation 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete this deployment you must have VMware Workstation 7 installed and
running on a PC running Microsoft Windows.

Before proceeding, download and extract the full disk image for VMWare
Workstation, as described in the "Distributed Files" section.

  1.	Launch VMware Workstation.

  2.	Click the Launch Existing VM or Team icon in the right-hand side of the
	window.  Browse the file system for the location where you extracted
	the contents of: 

  3.	Select Deploy from File and Browse the file system for location where
	you extracted the contents of: lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.tar.gz

	Select and Open the VMX file, e.g.: Lighthouse-vm.vmx

	The Opengear Lighthouse VM tab is displayed.

  4.	Click the "Power on this virtual machine" link located in the Commands
	box.

  5.	Deployment is now complete.  You can monitor the Lighthouse VM boot
	progress using the VMware Workstation console, or proceed to
	"Configuring Lighthouse VM" to begin configuration.


Example Cloud Deployment: ElasticHosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions are current as of 04 April 2013.

  1.	Browse to http://www.elastichosts.com and create an account at your
	preferred peer location.

  2.	You may wish to use the 5 day free hosting trial, otherwise add a
	subscription that meets the reserved resource requirements outlined
	under System Requirements in this document.

	Ensure you set 'Commited data transfer' to 10 GB or higher and/or have
	pre-pay balance to cover monthly data transfer.  Data usage by
	Lighthouse VM will vary with usage patterns, but will generally not be
	heavy.

	We recommend you purchase a static IP address, otherwise you must also
	configure Lighthouse VM to use a dynamic DNS service.

  3.	Upload lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.hdd as a drive using any of the methods
	described in:

	  http://www.elastichosts.com/question/how-can-i-upload-my-own-iso-cd-images/

	If you are deploying from a Linux or POSIX compliant system, we
	recommend using the drive upload tool script:

	  http://www.elastichosts.com/downloads/elastichosts-upload.sh

	Full documentation for the API and usage examples can be found here:

	  http://www.elastichosts.com/support/api/

	Your user UUID and secret API key is available on your Profile page. You
	should combine them into the EHAUTH environment variable:

	  export EHAUTH=<user uuid>:<secret API key>

	Your API endpoint URI is the hostname of account's peer location,
	preceded by "api.", e.g. for San Antonio Peer 1:

	  export EHURI=https://api.sat-p.elastichosts.com/

	After setting these in your environment, run:

	  ./elastichosts-upload.sh lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.hdd

  4.	From the Elastic Hosts Control Panel, select Server in 'Add server or
	drive'.  Enter a Name, e.g. "Lighthouse VM".  Select the Type of
	'Boot from existing drive'.  Select the Drive you uploaded in the
	previous step, e.g. "lighthouse-x.y.z-vm.hdd".  Click Add.

  5.	Click Edit on the Server you have just added.  Select the static IP
	address to use if available, and set the VNC password.  Click Start.

  6.	Deployment is now complete.  You can now monitor the Lighthouse VM boot 
	progress using VNC, or proceed to "Configuring Lighthouse VM" to begin
	configuration.


Configuring Lighthouse VM 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After initial install, you cannot log in to the Lighthouse VM until a root
password is set.

*** Connect to the virtual VGA console to set the root password. ***

After the root password is set, on first login, configuration information is
displayed. Further Lighthouse VM configuration can be performed by browsing to 
the IP address listed. (By default, the Lighthouse VM will have both an address
obtained via DHCP, and a static address of 192.168.0.1.)

The default credentials:

  root / <set via console on first start up>

Configuration instructions are available in the Lighthouse VM User Manual, from:
